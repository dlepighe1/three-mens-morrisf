# Three Men's Morris

Introduction: Tic-Tac-Toe is a universally-known game that people regularly play. However, it’s easy to get bored of the simplicity of the game and how easy it is to draw. Three Men’s Morris is a longer and more interesting two-player game with more strategy, which we hope to implement in a mobile application. This game also has a significant amount of history which we hope to preserve.
