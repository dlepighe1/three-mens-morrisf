# Three Men's Morris

Tic-Tac-Toe is a universally-known game that people regularly play. However, it’s easy to get bored of the simplicity of the game and how easy it is to draw. Three Men’s Morris is a longer and more interesting two-player game with more strategy, which we hope to implement in a mobile application. This game also has a significant amount of history which we hope to preserve.

Through our application, players can either choose to play with other humnan players or against our AI algorithm. The algorithm will have different difficult levels to account for differences in skills and comfort.
