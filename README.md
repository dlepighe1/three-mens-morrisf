# Three Men's Morris

Introduction: Tic-Tac-Toe is a universally-known game that people regularly play. However, it’s easy to get bored of the simplicity of the game and how easy it is to draw. Three Men’s Morris is a longer and more interesting two-player game with more strategy, which we hope to implement in a mobile application. This game also has a significant amount of history which we hope to preserve.

Frontend Components: The frontend is implemented using Android Studio and is responsible for the following:
- Keeping track of each user’s game states in a multiplayer game
- Outputting the current state of the game as a user interface for the player(s)
- Display will be made using components in Java and XML
- Moving/placing pieces to execute the user’s turn
- Determining the winner of each game

Backend Components: The backend is written in Java and is responsible for the following:
- Running an AI algorithm to play against the user:
- Python script that takes in the current game state and outputs a move that it will make
- Interacting with the UI components
